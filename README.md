# Advanced Bootstrap Blocks

This plugin allows you to build flexible, no-mess Bootstrap 4 layouts inside the Gutenberg editor. 

The following components are currently supported: 

 * Container
 * Row
 * Column

Bootstrap styles are included in the Gutenberg editor but need to be included in your theme (at least the bootstrap grid) for these blocks to appear correctly on your public-facing website. 

After enabling this plugin, a `Reusable Blocks` menu item will be available in Wordpress admin menu.

This plugin was developed and tested using [Understrap](https://understrap.com/). Please issues, feature-, and pull-requests through [https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/advanced-bootstrap-blocks](https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/advanced-bootstrap-blocks).
