# Gutenstrap - Bootstrap 4 Blocks for Gutenberg

No-mess Bootstrap 4 blocks for the Wordpress Gutenberg editor. The following components are supported: 

 * Container
 * Row
 * Column

Bootstrap styles are included in the Gutenberg editor but will need to be included in your theme (at least the bootstrap grid) for these blocks to appear correctly on your public-facing website. 

This plugin is intended to be used with the [Understrap Theme](https://understrap.com/). Please submit issues and pull requests through [https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/gutenstrap](https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/gutenstrap).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

>You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
