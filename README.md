Build responsive Bootstrap 4 layouts inside the Gutenberg editor. 


== Description ==
This plugin implements flexible, unopinionated Bootstrap 4 blocks for building custom page layouts in the Wordpress editor (aka Gutenberg.) The following components are currently supported: 

* Container (fixed-width, fluid)
* Row
* Column
* Button

Bootstrap styles are included in the Gutenberg editor but need to be included in your theme (at least the bootstrap grid) for these blocks to appear correctly on your public-facing website. Once enabled, `Reusable Blocks` will be available from Wordpress admin menu.

This plugin is developed, tested, and intended to be used within [Understrap](https://understrap.com/). 

Please submit issues, feature-, and pull-requests through [https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/advanced-bootstrap-blocks](https://gitlab.com/helpful.dev/advanced-bootstrap-blocks). 

== Changelog ==
## 1.0.4

* Adding basic `Button` component (with style, block, size, outline, new-window settings) 
* Minor README changes
